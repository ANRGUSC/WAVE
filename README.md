# WAVE_for_Jupiter

WAVE is a distributed scheduler for DAG type
task graph that outputs a mapping of tasks to real compute nodes.
It is a module used in [Jupiter](https://github.com/ANRGUSC/Jupiter).
We have two versions of WAVE: `random_WAVE` and `greedy_WAVE`

Note: We can not use WAVE as an independent tool
